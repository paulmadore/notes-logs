  <description>If the purpose of tool kits is to make developing UIs easier, then they should be less complex, I think. As much as I love spending half the day <code>RTFM</code>'ing, it seems even the most basic concepts have become overcomplicated by perhaps lack of focus. Let's hope that future renditions of Qt and GTK manage to unify things in such a way that new methods are interoperable with old ones, such that an old method will be automatically detected at compile time, and then the compiler informs you of how the exact same thing would look in the new version. Then you just update those lines, and you're still not spending the day learning multiple things to accomplish one basic task.</description>

  <description>Part of me feels like the computer should be doing all this for me. Google's Photos app can know when it's Christmas, the computer should therefore almost be to the point where it does what I mean.</description>

  <description>And why are you so stuck on continuing the zombie of Python 2.7 anyways?</description>
