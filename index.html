        <h2 class="subpst">Portabilty</h2>
        <p class="first">It occurs to me that there are hundreds of languages and "frameworks" being developed the world over, but few of them focus on being portable in a meaningful way. For instance, it would be somewhat trivial to create a library within your language that would source all things appropriately. If you know that <code>gcc-5</code> is going to break the code, you could ensure that <code>gcc-4.8</code> was available by installing it at execution time. If no trusted source existed, you could ask permission, find one, and carry on. What I envision this module to be is some kind of octopus which stretches out, but does not create a whole new instance in the way that containerization does.</p>
        <h2 class="subpst">!important</h2>
        <p class="first">When monkeying with HTML and CSS, the <code>!important</code> modifier is not to be used lightly. The first time I ever needed it was the other day. I couldn't figure out why something in this very site's code was not being targeted, as demonstrated by the <a href="https://github.com/paulmadore/notes-logs/commit/3f9712979a031f15414172fa1e0f1e8db2d44c11" target="_blank">number of times I tried</a>. Adding an !important flag worked. Only after trying everything else should you tell the browser that something is &ldquo;<code>!imporant</code>.&rdquo;</p>

             <p class="first">If the purpose of tool kits is to make developing UIs easier, then they should be less complex, I think. As much as I love spending half the day <code>RTFM</code>'ing, it seems even the most basic concepts have become overcomplicated by perhaps lack of focus. Let's hope that future renditions of Qt and GTK manage to unify things in such a way that new methods are interoperable with old ones, such that an old method will be automatically detected at compile time, and then the compiler informs you of how the exact same thing would look in the new version. Then you just update those lines, and you're still not spending the day learning multiple things to accomplish one basic task.</p>

        <p class="first">Organization is important in your daily work. I have too many copies of the same <code>home</code> folder floating around, because I don't want to lose them, and I keep putting off doing anything about them. I somewhat have a plan, but not really.</p>
        <p>I'm <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> organized enough to function.</p>
        <p>Part of me feels like the computer should be doing all this for me. Google's Photos app can know when it's Christmas, the computer should therefore almost be to the point where it does what I mean.</p>
